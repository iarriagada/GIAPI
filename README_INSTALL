Building the GIAPI C++ Language Glue requires some work since it depends
on third party products that must be fetched and installed. I expect the build
method to improve in the future though.

1. Required tools

The library was compiled for Linux using the following tools:

*   g++ (GCC) 4.1.2 20080704 (Red Hat 4.1.2-48)
*	GNU Make 3.81
*	GNU ld version 2.17.50.0.6-2.el5 20061020
*	RedHat Enterprise Linux 5 Server, Linux kernel 2.6.18-194.26.1.el5, 64-bit

The library must be compiled with GCC version 4.0 or above.

2. Set up the environment.

When building, you need to set up the following variables in the config.mk
file (located in the 'conf' directory):

INSTALL_DIR The directory where you want to have the library and headers
            installed to.

EXTERNAL_LIB The directory that contains the dependencies required to build
             the GIAPI C++ Language Glue.

SYSTEM_INCLUDE_DIR The directory where standard libraries are located.
                    Usually /usr/lib

The config.mk contains values for these three variables. Please adjust them
to your needs.

3. Build dependencies

The following are the libraries that need to be compiled and installed in the
system before building the GIAPI C++:

(Note that dependencies suitable for CentOS 7 are included in the external directory)

* APR and APR Util: These libraries are required to compile Active MQ CPP CMS,
  log4cxx and the GIAPI (see next dependencies).
  See the instructions at apr-1.3.12/README.md and apr-util-1.3.10/README.md

  To build the GIAPI, the APR headers need to be available.
  The APR_INCLUDE variable defined in the common.mk file is used to find these
  headers.
  On my system they were installed on EXTERNAL_LIB/apr/include/apr-1

* Active MQ CPP CMS.
  This library needs to be available in the EXTERNAL_LIB/activemq directory
  In my development environment, I declare EXTERNAL_LIB/activemq as a symlink
  to the place I define to install active mq using the 'configure --prefix'
  command
  You may want to disable ssl support as GIAPI doesn't require it. That avoids the
  need to instal openssl
  See the instructions at activemq-cpp-library-3.4.1/README.md

* Apache Log4cxx version 0.10.0. Obtained from
  http://logging.apache.org/log4cxx/
  This library needs to be available in the EXTERNAL_LIB/log4cxx directory
  Same as with active mq,  I declare EXTERNAL_LIB/log4cxx as a symlink
  to the place I define to install log4cxx using the 'configure --prefix'
  command
  See the instructions at apache-log4cxx-0.10.0/README.md

* CPP Unit 1.12.1.
  This library needs to be installed in the EXTERNAL_LIB/cppunit directory
  Same as with everything else,  I declare EXTERNAL_LIB/cppunit as a symlink
  to the place I define to install cppunit using the 'configure --prefix'
  command.
  See the instructions at cppunit-1.12.1/README.md

* libCurl 7.21.6
  This library needs to be installed in the EXTERNAL_LIB/libcurl directory
  Same as with everything else, I declare EXTERNAL_LIB/libcurl as a symlink
  to the place I define to install libcur.
  See instructions at curl-7.21.6/README.md

* cURLpp 0.7.3
  This library needs to be installed in the EXTERNAL_LIB/curlpp directory
  Same as with everything else, I declare EXTERNAL_LIB/curlpp as a symlink
  to the place I define to install cppunit using the 'configure --prefix --without-boost'
  command.
  See instructions at curlpp-0.7.3/README.md

4. Building the library

Once the external libraries are installed and the config.mk has been updated
with the right directory names, the system can be built just by typing:

  make

in the top level directory of the source tree.

If everything goes well, the system should build the libraries. To run the
the unit tests provided you have to have a GMP Broker up and running. Please
refer to the GMP documentation for instructions about how to do this. Once
the GMP is running, type

  make tests

to run the unit tests for the GIAPI library.

To install the library into the directory declared in the config.mk file,
just type:

  make install

That will put the library and header files in the INSTALL_DIR directory.
Headers will be in INSTALL_DIR/include and the library will be in INSTALL_DIR/lib

5. Linking with the library

In order for an executable to find the required libraries to link with during
run time, the system must be configured so that the libraries can be found.
Methods available: (Do at least one of the following)

   a) Add library directories to be included during dynamic linking to the file
      /etc/ld.so.conf

      Sample: /etc/ld.so.conf
          /usr/X11R6/lib
          /usr/lib
          ...
          ..
          /usr/lib/sane
          /usr/lib/mysql
          /opt/lib

      Add the INSTALL_DIR/lib library path to this file and then execute the
      command (as root) ldconfig to configure the linker run-time bindings.
      See man page for command ldconfig.

      OR

   b) Add specified directory to library cache: (as root)
      ldconfig -n INSTALL_DIR/lib

      This will NOT permanently configure the system to include this directory.
      The information will be lost upon system reboot.

      OR

   c) Specify the environment variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH to point to the directory
      paths containing the shared object library. This will specify to the run
      time loader that the library paths will be used during execution to
      resolve dependencies.

      This instructs the run time loader to look in the path described by the
      environment variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH, to resolve shared libraries.
